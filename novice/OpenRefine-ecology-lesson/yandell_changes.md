The main changes that Brian Yandell has done to OpenRefine lesson are as follows:

* added 3. [Filtering, Excluding and Sorting](02-filter-exclude-sort.html) lesson
* added 4. [Examining Numeric Data](03-numbers.html) lesson
* added 8. [Other Resources in OpenRefine](08-resources.html) page
* renumbered lessons to put these in sequence
* reworte 2. [Working with OpenRefine](01-working-with-openrefine.html) to improve flow

In each of `*.md` files (except `index.md`) I added a period (.) to the `minutes:` line of YAML code so that I could complile MD into HTML (see this file as well).
