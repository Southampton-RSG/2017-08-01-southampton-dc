## Motivation

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain. The lessons below are based upon using ecology data in 
R, and this is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. 

A typical data science project looks something like this:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
![[Data project workflow as shown in R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)](./img/data_project_pipeline.png)
</div>

The overall aim is to *understand and communicate* findings from our 
data, but this is preceded by the fundamental tasks of importing, tidying and 
often transforming the data. Transformation means for example, selecting a 
subset of the data to work with, or calculating the mean of a set of observations.

This entire process can be encompased within a single programming language. Here
we will be using R, but Python and other programming languages can acheive the
same thing.

These lessons are designed to be taught in a day, and cover only a fraction of
what is possible, but will help you take your first steps towards managing your
own data projects.

The lessons start with an overview of R and the RStudio interface and introduce
visualising data as the first tool for generating insights.

Data is rarely provided in the form we need, so the next set of tools we'll 
learn about are those for transforming data.

Armed with these tools, we'll tackle an ecology dataset from desert rodent 
surveys as a case study for **importing** CSV files, performing some 
basic **transformations**, and then **visualising** the data. By the end of this process we should be able to **understand and communicate** some general findings
obtained from the dataset.

Concretely, using a rodent survey data covering a period a period from 1977 to 
1991, we will aim to understand the effect on the populations of small 
seed eating rodents as a result of the exclusion of larger competitor kangeroo
rats. In doing so we will perform tasks common to many data projects 
irrespective of subject area.

**Note**:

Much of the material in the first two lessons is derived from [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) by Garrett Grolemund and
Hadley Wickham. This book contains many more detailed examples and advanced 
concepts not covered here.

### Chapters

1. [R and RStudio](01_R_and_Rstudio.html)
2. [Introduction to R](02_intro_to_R.html)
3. [Ecology Data Overiew](03_ecology_data_overview.html)
4. [Importing and inspecting the data](04_import_and_inspect.html)
5. [Transforming the data](05_transforming_data.html)
6. [Data visualization](06_visualising_data.html)
7. [Communication](07_summary_of_ecology_data.html)

### Data

Ideally all datasets should come with a codebook describing the contents, 
structure, and layout of a data collection. This is a text document containing information intended to be complete and self-explanatory for each variable in a 
data file. As this has not been generated for this data, we will use the description found in the [Ecology Data Overiew](06-ecology-data-overview.html). 

Data files for the lesson are available here: <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459>

We will download the *combined.csv* file during the lesson.

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below.  To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything *before* working through this lesson.

### Setup instructions

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install the
`tidyverse` package from within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for your
operating system, and then follow the instructions to install `tidyverse`.
More about the [tidyverse](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/).

#### Windows

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You may also want to consider removing your old version of R. You
  can
  [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  XP/Vista/7/8** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### MacOS X

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You may also want to consider removing your old version of R. You
  can
  [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the version of OS X that you have and the file will
  download
* Double clik on the downloaded file to install R
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of R for your distribution. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but the
  versions provided by this approach are usually out of date. In any case, make
  sure you have at least R 3.3.1
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### For everyone

**After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the "tidyverse" packages.**
More about the [tidyverse](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/).

* After starting RStudio, at the console type:
  `install.packages("tidyverse")`
