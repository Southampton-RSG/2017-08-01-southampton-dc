Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested
in working with ecology data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons can be taught in a day. They start with some basic
information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to
import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to
add/remove rows and columns, and finish with how to calculate summary statistics
for each level and a very brief introduction to plotting.

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below.  To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything *before* working through this lesson.

### Data

Data files for the lesson are available here: <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459>

Please download the *\*.csv* (Comma Separated Value) files: *species.csv*,
*plots.csv*, *surveys.csv*, and *combined.csv*.


### Setup instructions

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install the
`tidyverse` package from within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for your
operating system, and then follow the instructions to install `tidyverse` and
`RSQLite`.

#### Windows

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You may also want to consider removing your old version of R. You
  can
  [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  XP/Vista/7/8** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### MacOS X

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You may also want to consider removing your old version of R. You
  can
  [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the version of OS X that you have and the file will
  download
* Double clik on the downloaded file to install R
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of R for your distribution. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but the
  versions provided by this approach are usually out of date. In any case, make
  sure you have at least R 3.3.1
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### For everyone

**After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the "tidyverse" and
"RSQLite" packages.**

* After starting RStudio, at the console type:
  `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "RSQLite"))`
