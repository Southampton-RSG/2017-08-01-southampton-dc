### Narrative

#### Before we start

* The main goal here is to help the learners be comfortable with the RStudio
  interface. We use RStudio because it helps make using R more organized and
  user friendly.
* The "Why learning R?" section contains suggestions of what you could tell your
  learners about the benefits of learning R. However, it's best if you can talk
  here about what has worked for you personally.
* The seeking help section is relatively long, and while it's useful to
  demonstrate a couple of ways to get help from within R, you may want to mostly
  point the workshop participants to this useful reference so that they can
  refer to it after the workshop.
* In the "where to ask for help section?", you may want to emphasize the first
  point about how workshops are a great way to create community of learners that
  can help each others during and after the workshop.


#### Intro to R

#### Starting with data

#### Manipulating data with dplyr

#### Visualizing data with ggplot2

#### Using databases from R

* Ideally this lesson is best taught at the end of the workshop to illustrate
  how the tools covered can integrate with each others. Depending on the
  audience, and the pace of the workshop, it can be suitable to be shown as a
  demonstration rather than a typically lesson.
* The explanation of how dplyr's verb syntax is translated into SQL statements,
  and the section on lazyness are optional and don't need to be taught in detail
  during a workshop. They can be useful after a workshop for learners interested
  in learninig more about the topics or for instructors to answer questions from
  the workshop participants.


### Potential issues & solutions

As it stands, the solutions to all the challenges are commented out in the Rmd
files. If you want to double check your answer, you can look at the source code
of the Rmd files on GitHub.

Sometimes a package will not install, try a different CRAN mirror
- Tools > Global Options > Packages > CRAN Mirror

Alternatively you can go to CRAN and download the package and install from ZIP file
-   Tools > Install Packages > set to 'from Zip/TAR'
