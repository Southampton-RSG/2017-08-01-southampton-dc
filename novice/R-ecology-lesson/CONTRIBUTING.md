# Contributing New Material

Data Carpentry is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all
kinds: new and improved lessons, bug reports, and small fixes to existing
material are all useful.

By contributing, you are agreeing that Data Carpentry may redistribute your work
under [these licenses](LICENSE.md).

## Working With GitHub

**NOTE: this repository uses `gh-pages` as our default branch.**

1.  Fork the `datacarpentry/R-ecology` repository on GitHub.

2.  Clone that repository to your own machine. (It is also possible to make minor edits right on GitHub.)

3.  Create a branch from `gh-pages` for your changes.
    Give your branch a meaningful name,
    such as `fixing-typos-r-ecology-lesson`
    or `adding-tutorial-on-visualization`.

4.  Make your changes, commit them, and push them to your repository on GitHub.
    If your change affects a lesson, please only commit and push the `Rmd`
    files. The rendered versions will be generated by the lesson maintainer to
    avoid merge conflicts.

5.  Send a pull request to the `gh-pages` branch of the datacarpentry
    repository for this lesson at http://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology

If it is easier for you to send them to us some other way,
please mail us at
[board@datacarpentry.org](mailto:board@datacarpentry.org).
Given a choice between you creating content or wrestling with Git,
we'd rather have you doing the former.


## File Locations and Formats

Each lesson contains files such as `00-intro.Rmd`, `01-filedir.Rmd` and so on.
(We use two digits followed by a one-word topic key to ensure files appear in
the right order when listed.)

For the R material, lessons must be written in RMarkdown (ending in
`Rmd`). A Makefile converts
the Rmd files into HTML that are processed by Jekyll (the tool GitHub uses to
create websites) as explained in [the README file](README.md).

Currently, the Makefile also generates the README file from `index.md`.

_Important Note:_ We use the `purl()` function from `knitr` to generate
a skeleton file that contains code to be distributed to the workshop
participants. This strategy is useful in particular for error-prone pieces of
code (e.g., if it contains long URLs). To take full advantage, every line of
code that should be included in the handout **must** be enclosed in an `R` code
chunk with `purl=TRUE` in the chunk options. Further, to aid students' use of
the handout code, consider including explanatory comments. When writing
Challenges in particular, you may need to include redundant comments and used
the chunk option `echo=FALSE`. If in doubt consult the `Rmd` files for
examples.

## Datasets

We don't store data for lessons inside the lesson repositories. For completed
lessons the data should be publicly available in a data repository appropriate
to the data type. For lesson development the data may be provided in any way
that is convenient including posting to a website, on
[figshare](http://figshare.com/), a public dropbox link, a
[GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com), or even included in the PR. Once the PR
is ready to merge the data should be placed in the
[official data repository](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459.v5)
and all links to the data updated.

## Formatting of the material

To ensure a consistent formatting of the lessons, we recommend the following
guidelines:

* No trailing white space
* Wrap lines at 80 characters (unless it breaks URLs)
* Use consistent capitalization (e.g., R not r, RStudio not rstudio or Rstudio)
* Function names are written as `function()` while variables and packages are
  written as `variable`
* Use unclosed atx style headers (see below):

```
## Use this format for headers

And not this format

```
