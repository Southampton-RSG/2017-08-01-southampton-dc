## What is R? What is RStudio?

*There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses* - Bjarne Stroustrup

R is a programming language that follows the philosophy laid down by it's
predecessor S that users begin in an interactive environment where they don't 
consciously think of themselves as programming. It was created in 1993, and in 
1996 it was documented in a paper entitled 

*Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. R: A language for data analysis and graphics. 
Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 5(3):299â€“314, 1996*

Reasons it has become popular include that it is both open source and cross platform,
and that it has broad functionality, from the analysis of data and creating 
powerful graphical visualisations and web apps.

Like all languages though it has limitations, for example the syntax is initially
confusing.

R Studio is an integrated development environment, or IDE for R programming. It 
is regularly updated, and upgrading enables access to the latest features. The
latest version can be downloaded here: http://www.rstudio.com/download.

## Why learn R ? Or any language ?

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the
code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and
spot mistakes.

Working with scripts forces you to have deeper understanding of what you are
doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use:

+ Writing and publishing code is important for reproducible research
+ R has many thousands of packages covering many disciplines.
+ R can work with many types of data.
+ They is a large R community for development and support.
+ Using R (or Python) gives you control over your figures and reports.

## Finding your way around RStudio

Let's begin by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

We will use R Studio IDE to write code, navigate the files found on our computer,
inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will
generate. R Studio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control,
developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the
workshop.

R Studio is divided into "Panes". When you first open it, there are three panes, 
the console where you type commands, your environment/history (top-right), and 
your files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right).

The environment shows all the R objects you have created or are using, such
as data you have imported.

The output pane can be used to view any plots you have created.

Not opened at first start up is the fourth default pane: the script editor pane, 
but this will open as soon as we create/edit a R script (or many other document types). *The script editor is where will be typing much of the time.*

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, 
R Studio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout). 

One of the advantages of using R Studio is that all the information you need to
write code is available in a single window. 
Additionally, with many short cuts, auto-completion, and highlighting for the major
file types you use while developing in R, R Studio will make typing easier and 
less error-prone.

## What is real?

At the start, we might consider our environment "real" - that is to say the objects
we've created/loaded and are using are "real". But it's much better in the long run
to consider our scripts as "real" - our scripts are where we write down the code
that creates our objects that we'll be using in our environment.

**As a script is a document, it is reproducible**

Or to put it another way: we can easily recreate an environment from our scripts, 
but not so easily create a script from an environment.

To support this notion of thinking in terms of our scripts as real, we recommend
turning off the preservation of workspaces between sessions by setting the Tools >
Global Options menu in R studio as shown below.

We'll learn more about scripts as we go along.

## Where am I?

R studio tells you where you are in terms of directory address on the console
pane.

This might not seem immediately important, but this will be useful when we
discuss more about how to organise our work later on.

## Running R code

We can just use R like a calculator and run code directly like so:

```{r,results='show'}
2 + 2
```

The answer is returned to console.

Or we can assign objects and work with them instead. 

Once again, I'll return to this in more detail later, but for now let's assign 
an object the value of two using the `<-` operator (use Alt + - (the minus sign) to speed things up):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
x <- 2
```

Nothing is returned to the console, but if we type the object name or look in 
our environment pane, we can see that `x` exists with a value of 2.

> ### Challenge
> Return the value of `x` to the console i.e. type `x`and press Enter.
>
> What is the value of `x + x` ?

### Functions

Functions in R are in the form of the function name and parentheses
like so: `function_name()`. Arguments that are supplied to the function go 
inside the parentheses.

Let's try the combine function, represented by a small letter `c` to combine 
some numbers into a group called a vector, and at the same time assign them to
an object called `my_numbers`

```{r,purl=FALSE}

my_numbers <- c(2,4,6)

```


Here, `c` is the  function and 2,4 and 8 are the arguments we supply, and we
assign the output to the `my_numbers` object.
Now inspect `my_numbers` by typing it into the console and pressing Enter,
and by looking at the Environment pane.

> ### Challenge
> Find the mean of `my_numbers` by using `my_numbers` as the argument 
to `mean()`
>
> The arithmetic mean of (2+4+6)/3 = 4

### Loading packages

When using R we pretty much always want to use packages that aren't in the base
R installation. These we download and install using the `install.packages()`
function, and can then be loaded as libraries at the start of each session, using
the `library()` function.

We will be using packages from the `tidyverse` throughout, so if you've not
already done so, install the tidyverse like so:

```{r,purl=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

and then load it:

```{r,purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Seeking help

There are three main ways to get help: One is to use the `?` function, two is
to search on-line, and three is to talk to someone.

### Help within RStudio

We can only use the question mark query on packages that we've loaded, and 
since we've loaded the tidyverse, let's query it:

```{r,purl=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
?tidyverse
```

**Note** When querying a function, we leave off the parentheses.

If you know the name of the function you want to use, but are unsure 
how to use it, let's say `mean()`, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?mean
```

### Searching for help on-line

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the
[rdocumention.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that searches through
the help files across all packages available.

A Google or internet search "R \<task\>" will often either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum question that someone else already asked,
such as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).

### Asking for help on-line or off

The key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package
is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant,
but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key
point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as
precise as possible when describing your problem.

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple *reproducible
example*. For more information on how to write a
reproducible example see [this article by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html).

**Always include the output of `sessionInfo()`**
as it provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and
the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful
to understand your problem.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

## Re-cap

We've taken a brief tour of R and R Studio, along the way we:

+ saw the layout of R Studio including the environment, console and output panes.
+ run some R code, assigned some R objects and used some R functions.
+ discussed where to start when we get stuck and need help.

Next we'll introduce using R in a concretely practical way.
