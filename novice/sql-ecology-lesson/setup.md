SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.  We
use a simple database manager called [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)
in our lessons.
    

We will use [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
    plugin for the [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). If you don't have Firefox installed, you need to install it first and
