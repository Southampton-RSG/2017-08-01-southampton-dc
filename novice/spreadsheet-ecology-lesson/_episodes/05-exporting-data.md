Storing the data you're going to work with for your analyses in Excel
default file format (`*.xls` or `*.xlsx` - depending on the Excel
version) is a bad idea. Why?

- Because it is a **proprietary format**, and it is possible that in
  the future, technology won’t exist (or will become sufficiently
  rare) to make it inconvenient, if not impossible, to open the file.

  Think about zipdisks. How many old theses in your lab are “backed
  up” and stored on zipdisks? Ever wanted to pull out the raw data
  from one of those? *Exactly.*

- Other spreadsheet software may not be able to open files
  saved in a proprietary Excel format.

- Different versions of Excel may handle data
  differently, leading to inconsistencies.

- Finally, more journals and grant agencies are requiring you
  to deposit your data in a data repository, and most of them don't
  accept Excel format. It needs to be in one of the formats
  discussed below.

As an example of inconsistencies in data storage, do you remember how we talked about how Excel stores dates earlier? It turns out that 
there are multiple defaults for different versions of the software, and you can switch between them all. So, say you’re
compiling Excel-stored data from multiple sources. There’s dates in each file- Excel interprets them as their own internally consistent
serial numbers. When you combine the data, Excel will take the serial number from the place you’re importing it from, and interpret it
using the rule set for the version of Excel you’re using. Essentially, you could be adding errors to your data, and it wouldn’t
necessarily be flagged by any data cleaning methods if your ranges overlap.

Storing data in a universal, open, and static format will help deal with this problem. Try tab-delimited (tab separated values
or TSV) or comma-delimited (comma separated values or CSV). CSV files are plain text files where the columns are separated by commas,
hence 'comma separated values' or CSV. The advantage of a CSV file over an Excel/SPSS/etc. file is that we can open and read a CSV file
using just about any software, including plain text editors like TextEdit or NotePad. 
Data in a CSV file can also be easily imported into other formats and
environments, such as SQLite and R. We're not tied to a certain version of a certain expensive program when we work with CSV files, so
it's a
good format to work with for maximum portability and endurance. Most spreadsheet programs can save to delimited text formats like CSV
easily, although they may give you a warning during the file export.

To save a file you have opened in Excel in `*.csv` format:

1. From the top menu select 'File' and 'Save as'.
2. In the 'Format' field, from the list, select 'Comma Separated Values' (`*.csv`).
3. Double check the file name and the location where you want to save it and hit 'Save'.

An important note for backwards compatibility: you can open CSV files in Excel!

## A Note on Cross-platform Operability

By default, most coding and statistical environments expect UNIX-style line endings (`\n`) as representing line breaks.  However, Windows uses an alternate line ending signifier (`\r\n`) by default for legacy compatibility with Teletype-based systems.  As such, when exporting to CSV using Excel, your data will look like this:

>data1,data2\r\n1,2\r\n4,5\r\n…

which, upon passing into most environments (which split on `\n`), will parse as:

>data1<br>
>data2\r<br>
>1<br>
>2\r<br>
>...

thus causing terrible things to happen to your data.  For example, `2\r` is not a valid integer, and thus will throw an error (if you’re lucky) when you attempt to operate on it in R or Python.  Note that this happens on Excel for OSX as well as Windows, due to legacy Windows compatibility.

There are a handful of solutions for enforcing uniform UNIX-style line endings on your exported CSV files:

1. When exporting from Excel, save as a “Windows comma separated (.csv)” file
2. If you store your data file under version control (which you should be doing!) using Git, edit the `.git/config` file in your repository to automatically translate `\r\n` line endings into `\n`.
Add the follwing to the file ([see the detailed tutorial](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-30-excel-and-line-endings)):

		[filter "cr"]
    		clean = LC_CTYPE=C awk '{printf(\"%s\\n\", $0)}' | LC_CTYPE=C tr '\\r' '\\n'
    		smudge = tr '\\n' '\\r'` 
    
 	and then create a file `.gitattributes` that contains the line:
 
 		*.csv filter=cr
 
	
3. Use [dos2unix](http://dos2unix.sourceforge.net/) (available on OSX, *nix, and Cygwin) on local files to standardize line endings.

#### A note on R and `xls`

There are R packages that can read `xls` files (as well as
Google spreadsheets). It is even possible to access different
worksheets in the `xls` documents.

**But**

- some of these only work on Windows
- this equates to replacing a (simple but manual) export to `csv` with
  additional complexity/dependencies in the data analysis R code
- **data formatting best practice still apply**
- Is there really a good reason why `csv` (or similar) is not adequate?

#### Caveats on commas

In some datasets, the data values themselves may include commas (,). In that case, the software which you use (including Excel)
will most likely incorrectly display the data in columns. This is because the commas which are a part of the data values will be
interpreted as delimiters.

If you are working with data that contains commas, you likely will need to use another delimiter when working in a spreadsheet. In this
case, consider using tabs as your delimiter and working with TSV files. TSV files can be exported from spreadsheet
programs in the same way as CSV files.
